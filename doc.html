        The Document Type Declaration, commonly referred to as the "DOCTYPE" in HTML, is a crucial element that defines the version and type of HTML used in a web document. <br>It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. The purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration is to inform the web browser about the version of HTML or XHTML being used in the document, <br>which helps the browser to render the page correctly.</p>
